This is a tool that translates user input or natural language queries into SQL queries to interact with databases. 
For reference I have created a student database to try out the queries.
I have created a conda environment named venv and taken the api key of google gemini pro from makersuite.google.com.
Streamlit is the user interface that I have choosen.
